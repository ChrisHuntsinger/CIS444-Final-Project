                    What can I say? Jurassic Park is one of the most underrated movies ever. Yes, I did say underrated. 
                    True, it is the fourth highest grossing movie ever (for the time being) and was a motion picture bible 
                    for eight-year-olds across the country, but it has never been regarded as artistically superior. When, 
                    in reality, it is one of the most artistically inventive movies ever. It contains all of Spielberg's 
                    magical strokes of genius from fantastic art direction and wonderful camera techniques to astounding 
                    technical quality ( which comes from his well known control over technology). The minor flaws of a 
                    theme park are masterfully embedded into the art direction, script etc. and the acting is superb. 
                    This is one of the only movies I've seen with great acting by children. Spielberg's camera usage ranges 
                    from foreshadowing the appearance of dinosaurs with extreme up-angles to exquisitely composed scenes of 
                    the dinosaurs' "interaction" with the characters. Aside from technical quality, Jurassic Park bears 
                    powerful social messages of human intrusion and destruction of natural environment and the self-revering 
                    nature of man. Also, it had an undeniable effect on cinema being one of the first movies to use CGI at 
                    such a large scale. However, the most ingenious aspect of the film is the portrayal of the dinosaurs 
                    as animals rather than ruthless monsters. At many times throughout the movie, the humans are portrayed 
                    as antagonists and the respect and appreciation of the dinosaurs is wonderfully developed. And, best 
                    of all, like star wars you can analyze the movie all you want or just sit back and enjoy the ride.
