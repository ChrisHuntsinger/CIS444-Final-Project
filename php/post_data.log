    [reviewContent] => Just fresh out of the cinema after seeing Five Nights at Freddy's, so here's my spoiler free review for it.

Now, personally, I don't find the actual concept of FNAF all that scary so I personally wasn't "scared" watching this. The jumpscares were effective but did this movie ever really make me feel uneasy? No, not really. But again, that's personal preference and not a dig at the movie at all.

The sound design, cinematography and the overall design of everything (from the animatronics to the actual restaurant) is incredible.

Now, here in the UK the film is rated 15 (which means children cannot watch it. Even if they are accompanied by an adult). In the USA, I know it's PG-13. For Americans who are probably wondering "Can I take my kid to see this?". Well, that's down to you. The film isn't overloaded with gory imagery, but there are one or two moments where it is extremely brutal, so just keep that in mind.

The "twist" at the end, and yes there's a twist, is... predictable, in all honesty. If you don't know anything about the lore, then yeah it might catch you off guard. But if you're even just slightly knowledgable about it, you probably wouldn't call it a twist.

Out of the horror movies I have seen, I'd honestly say this is one of the more lighthearted ones. There's a lot of humour here, as well as moments that do kinda make you think "Is this a horror film?". It's not "balls-to-the-wall" scary and I honestly don't think it was trying to be, nor does it need to be. It's just a fun film with horror elements, to me.

Overall, really enjoyed it and would recommend it if you're wanting something to watch for spooky season that is not too intense. It'd also be a great entry for anyone just getting into horror movies.
